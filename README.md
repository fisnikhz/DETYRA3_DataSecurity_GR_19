# DETYRA3_DataSecurity_GR_19
This repository contains an implementation of the Hill Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm using matrices. The Hill Cipher is a symmetric key cryptographic algorithm that operates on blocks of text.


## Features

Encryption of plain text using a key matrix of size 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4.
Decryption of cipher text using the inverse of the key matrix.
Support for text in the English alphabet (A-Z) and common special characters.
Handling of input text length that is not divisible by the key matrix size.

## Requirements

JavaFX: The application is built using JavaFX, so make sure you have JavaFX installed on your system.
